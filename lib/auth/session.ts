/**
 * @deprecated This file contains legacy auth functions no longer used since migrating to Supabase Auth.
 * All authentication is now handled by Supabase Auth.
 * 
 * This file is kept temporarily for reference but all functions are deprecated:
 * - Session management: Supabase Auth handles JWT tokens automatically
 * - Password hashing: Supabase Auth handles password hashing
 * 
 * TODO: Remove this file once migration is confirmed complete.
